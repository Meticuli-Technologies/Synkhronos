# Synkhronos

## The General Idea
Sometimes, working with dependencies can a big pain. We might want some libraries that aren't present on GitHub, or you can't access them from Maven, etc.
The solution is to use Synkhronos!

### The Application
This application is intended for usage on the desktop. The application will be able to automatically update your libraries as needed.

### The APi
Using the API allows an application to be able to use its libraries like modules, and create instances of objects found in the libraries.
Because of this, the application can automaticaly update its code.
It permits the application to directly update its libraries without updating its code.
